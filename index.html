  <h1>WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?</h1>
  <p>You might be pretty sure where you will be later today or tomorrow, but can you say for sure where you will be next week or next year? The uncertainties of life make it hard to know where we are headed; the farther away something is, the more unpredictable it becomes. Maybe this is why so many people are unsure of where they are headed for eternityâ€”it can seem so far away. But is eternity really a mysterious unknown?</p>
