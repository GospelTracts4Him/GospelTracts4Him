  <h1>WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?</h1>
  <p>You might be pretty sure where you will be later today or tomorrow, but can you say for sure where you will be next week or next year? The uncertainties of life make it hard to know where we are headed; the farther away something is, the more unpredictable it becomes. Maybe this is why so many people are unsure of where they are headed for eternity—it can seem so far away. But is eternity really a mysterious unknown?</p>

  <h2>CAN WE KNOW?</h2>
  <p>Can we know that we are on the right road, the one that will bring us safe and secure to Heaven? Yes, this precious information is given to us in God’s “road map,” the Bible. It says that we can know, positively, where we are going to be throughout all eternity. According to the Bible, there are people who, right now, are saved from the wrath of God: “The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God” (1 Corinthians 1:18). These people know that they have eternal life: “These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life” (1 John 5:13).</p>

  <h2>HOW MANY WAYS ARE THERE?</h2>
  <p>Religious people have many conflicting theories about how to please God. But their ways of salvation are powerless and futile because they are based, in one way or another, upon human effort or human merit. Some would have you try to reform and live better, some would tell you to keep the Ten Commandments or the Golden Rule. Some would have you go through certain church rituals: baptism, confirmation, and so on. But in the Bible, we learn that we are corrupt and fallen creatures whose religious efforts are useless in God’s sight. “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). “We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6).</p>

  <p>God has only one way of salvation for sinners. His way is not based upon any human reform or effort, but upon the finished work of His beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Because He was without sin or guilt, Jesus was the only one qualified to stand in man’s place before God, paying for man’s sin with His own blood. “The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me” (John 14:6).</p>

  <h2>HOW DO I GET THERE?</h2>
  <p>God’s map is clear. His directions are simple. The hardest part is for us to admit that we are on the wrong road, and headed in the wrong direction. It’s hard for us to face up to the cold reality that we don’t measure up in God’s sight. Basically, it’s hard for us to repent, to acknowledge before God that we are wrong and He is right—that we are sinful and He is holy. “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out” (Acts 3:19).</p>

  <p>God loves you. He has given His only Son to die for your sins. He is “not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). If you will come to Him as a guilty and undeserving sinner, He will give you eternal life as a free gift, bought and paid for on the cross of Calvary. “The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:23).</p>
