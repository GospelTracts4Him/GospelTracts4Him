    <h1>The Fall</h1>
    <p>
      Crunching leaves, brilliant colors, and crisp breezes are all signs that fall has begun. Many people look forward
      to this time of change, as summer heat gives way to cooler days, and autumn hues overspread the landscape.
      Fall is also a fun time, with harvest festivals and other special events and celebrations.
