    <h1>The Fall</h1>
    <p>Crunching leaves, brilliant colors, and crisp breezes are all signs that fall has begun. Many people look forward to this time of change, as summer heat gives way to cooler days, and autumn hues overspread the landscape. Fall is also a fun time, with harvest festivals and other special events and celebrations.</p>
    <h2>THE FIRST FALL</h2>
    <p>Do you know what the Bible says about the first “fall”? When God created the heavens and earth, He created mankind in His own image. Everything was perfect; Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden and walked in close fellowship with their Creator. But all this changed when they disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit. Because of this one act of disobedience, Adam and Eve fell from innocence into sin, the result of which was separation from God and eventual death (see Genesis 3).</p>
    <h2>ALL HAVE FALLEN</h2>
    <p>The bad news is that you and I have fallen, too. The Bible says that “we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away” (Isaiah 64:6). Just like Adam and Eve, we are all headed for death and eternal separation from God. The Bible makes it clear that we cannot reverse our fallen state on our own, and that unless we receive help, we have “no hope” (Ephesians 2:8, 9, 12). The warning is clear: “it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Hebrews 10:31).</p>
    <h2>THE REMEDY FOR OUR FALL</h2>
    <p>The good news is that we are not without help. God loves us so much that He sent His only Son, Jesus, to die in our place and to endure the punishment that we deserve. Jesus then rose from the dead and offers forgiveness and eternal life to all who turn to Him in faith, trusting in Him alone. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).</p>
    <p>God is reaching down to lift us up from our fallen state. Will you look to Him and receive His offer of salvation today? Jesus said, “Everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up on the last day” (John 6:40).</p>
