      <h1>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL?</h1>
      <p>Two friends were talking on religious topics. They discussed the question of punishment for sin in a future life. They settled to their own satisfaction that there was none. They decided that hell was a myth. They argued that there was no need for God or a Supreme Being since scientists say that the universe and life and man could have come into being through "natural" causes. And they agreed that even if there were a God, He would be a God of love and thus could not consign His creatures to everlasting punishment.</p>
      
      <p>Then a Christian, who had been a silent listener to the discussion asked:</p>
        <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL?</h2>
  <p>The question fell on the ears and hearts of the other two with crushing force. The power of God was felt in these searching words of truth. Solemn silence reigned for some minutes. God had spoken.</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL,</h2>
  <p>that the God of the Bible is real and living? Would you, a mortal being, be willing to risk your eternal destiny by arguing against the eternal "God who cannot lie" (Titus 1:2)? "He that believeth not God hath made Him a liar" (1 John 5:10).</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL,</h2>
  <p>that "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1:1)? When you stand before the Creator-God on the day of judgment, what reason will you offer for having given all the glory and credit for the beauties and glories of the earth and the universe to the impersonal "god" of chance and nature rather than the personal Creator-God?</p>

  <p>Scientists, in fact, do NOT have a reasonable explanation for the origin of the universe. If the universe exploded into being via the "Big Bang," they cannot explain where the original matter and energy came from. This is just a feeble attempt to replace the eternal, personal Creator-God with an eternal but impersonal matter-energy-god. Many scientists, and others too, would prefer to believe that a personal God does not exist; that way they are free to be their own "gods," living their lives however they please, without having to worry about what God thinks. The Bible talks about such people: "Every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25). "We have turned every one to his own way" (Isaiah 53:6).</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL,</h2>
  <p>that God must punish sin? While God's very nature is love (1 John 4:16), He is also a holy God who hates evil (Psalm 97:10; 99:9; Proverbs 8:13). How would you fare before God as Judge? What could you say to Him? "He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man [Jesus] whom He hath ordained; whereof He hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead" (Acts 17:31).</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL,</h2>
  <p>that hell is a reality? A skeptic sneeringly asked: "Where is hell?" The ready and true answer came: "At the end of a Christ-rejecting life." Let me ask you: What lies at the end of the path you are now treading? The Scripture says: "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment" (Hebrews 9:27).</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL,</h2>
  <p>that the Lord Jesus is the only Saviour, and His death and resurrection provide the only means by which you can be fitted for God's presence? Jesus said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me" (John 14:6). What if you ignore Him and leave Him out of your life? "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?" (Hebrews 2:3). "God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting lifeâ€¦. He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God" (John 3:16,18).</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL,</h2>
  <p>that the much-despised blood of Jesus is the only thing that can cleanse you from your sins? Has it cleansed you before God, or are you still heading toward the eternity of the lost? "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7).</p>
  <h2>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL?</h2>
  <p>How terrible will be your doom if you "die in your sins" (John 8:24). Dear friend, flee to Christ and be saved. "Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire" (Revelation 20:15).</p>

   <p>Be assured that IT IS TRUE, with a guarantee of "fulness of joy" and "pleasures for evermore" in God's presence (Psalm 16:11) for all who place their trust in Christ for salvation. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" (Acts 16:31).</p>
      <p>Act upon it today! "Now is the day of salvation" (2 Corinthians 6:2).</p>
