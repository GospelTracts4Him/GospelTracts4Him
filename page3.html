      <h1>SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL?</h1>
      <p>Two friends were talking on religious topics. They discussed the question of punishment for sin in a future life. They settled to their own satisfaction that there was none. They decided that hell was a myth. They argued that there was no need for God or a Supreme Being since scientists say that the universe and life and man could have come into being through "natural" causes. And they agreed that even if there were a God, He would be a God of love and thus could not consign His creatures to everlasting punishment.</p>
      
      <p>Then a Christian, who had been a silent listener to the discussion asked: "SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE AFTER ALL?" The question fell on the ears and hearts of the other two with crushing force. The power of God was felt in these searching words of truth. Solemn silence reigned for some minutes. God had spoken.</p>
