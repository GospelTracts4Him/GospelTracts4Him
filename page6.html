    <h1>Somebody Loves You</h1>

    <p>
      The creator of all things loves YOU so much that He sent His only Son, Jesus, to die for you on the cross.
      He wants to forgive your sins and make you clean so that you can be with Him for all eternity.
      Isn’t it amazing to know that you are loved by God?
    </p>

    <h2>HIS LOVE FOR YOU IS...</h2>

    <p><strong>Unending:</strong> God’s love is eternal. He loved you yesterday, loves you today and will love you forever! 
      “I have loved thee with an everlasting love.” (Jeremiah 31:3)
    </p>

    <p><strong>Unselfish:</strong> God didn’t wait for us to love Him first. His love was freely given. 
      “We love Him, because He first loved us.” (1 John 4:19)
    </p>

    <p><strong>Undeserved:</strong> God is holy, righteous, and just. As sinners, we have done nothing to deserve God’s love. 
      But He loves us anyway. “But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)
    </p>

    <p><strong>Unimaginable:</strong> God’s love led Him to send His son Jesus to bear the punishment for our sins on the cross. 
      Can you imagine watching someone you love being punished to the point of death for something they didn’t do? 
      “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)
    </p>

    <p><strong>Undying:</strong> God didn’t only send Jesus to die for our sins. He then raised Him from the dead so we can have eternal life. 
      What a wonderful gift He offers us! “In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.” (1 John 4:9)
    </p>

    <p><strong>Unmerited:</strong> God offers you the free gift of salvation through Jesus Christ. Because it is a gift, you cannot earn it. 
      Instead, you must see your need of salvation and accept it by trusting Jesus as your Savior. 
      “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)
    </p>

    <p>
      How can you receive God’s gift of salvation? The Bible says: 
      “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” (Romans 10:9)
      It’s that easy! Will you choose to accept God’s love? Then you too can experience God’s unfathomable love for all eternity! 
      “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39)
