    <h1>WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?</h1>
    <p>
      You might be pretty sure where you will be later today or tomorrow, but can you say for sure where you will
      be next week or next year? The uncertainties of life make it hard to know where we are headed; the farther
      away something is, the more unpredictable it becomes. Maybe this is why so many people are unsure of where
      they are headed for eternity—it can seem so far away. But is eternity really a mysterious unknown?
    </p>

    <h2>CAN WE KNOW?</h2>
    <p>
      Can we know that we are on the right road, the one that will bring us safe and secure to Heaven? Yes, this
      precious information is given to us in God’s “road map,” the Bible. It says that we can know, positively, where
      we are going to be throughout all eternity. According to the Bible, there are people who, right now, are saved
      from the wrath of God: “The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are
      saved it is the power of God” (1 Corinthians 1:18). These people know that they have eternal life: “These things
      have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life”
      (1 John 5:13).
    </p>

    <h2>HOW MANY WAYS ARE THERE?</h2>
    <p>
      Religious people have many conflicting theories about how to please God. But their ways of salvation are
      powerless and futile because they are based, in one way or another, upon human effort or human merit. Some
      would have you try to reform and live better, some would tell you to keep the Ten Commandments or the
      Golden Rule. Some would have you go through certain church rituals: baptism, confirmation, and so on. But in
      the Bible, we learn that we are corrupt and fallen creatures whose religious efforts are useless in God’s sight.
      “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). “We are all as an unclean thing, and all
      our righteousnesses are as filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6).
    </p>

    <h2>HOW DO I GET THERE?</h2>
    <p>
      God’s map is clear. His directions are simple. The hardest part is for us to admit that we are on the wrong road,
      and headed in the wrong direction. It’s hard for us to face up to the cold reality that we don’t measure up in
      God’s sight. Basically, it’s hard for us to repent, to acknowledge before God that we are wrong and He is
      right—that we are sinful and He is holy. “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
      out” (Acts 3:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      God loves you. He has given His only Son to die for your sins. He is “not willing that any should perish, but that
      all should come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). If you will come to Him as a guilty and undeserving sinner, He will
      give you eternal life as a free gift, bought and paid for on the cross of Calvary. “The gift of God is eternal life
      through Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
    </p>

    <h2>KNOWING FOR SURE</h2>
    <p>
      When you turn to God, putting your faith in Jesus Christ who died for you and rose again, salvation will be your
      eternal possession (John 10:27-30). Listen to the words of Jesus: “Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast
      out” (John 6:37). “He that heareth My Word, and believeth onHim that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life” (John 5:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      Where are you headed? If you’re not on God’s way, you’re on the wrong way! Right now is the time to turn
      around, call out to God, and put your trust in Jesus.
